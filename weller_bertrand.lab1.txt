16. I like how easy print statements are to use and implement.  You don't need to 
use '+' or '{0}' with listed arguments like in other languages.

17. I don't like the syntax for subroutines.  The keyword 'sub' seems nonessential, 
yet it is required.  Also, from the function header, you cannot tell what it returns 
or what types of arguments the subroutine takes.  This then makes it difficult to 
access the arguments.

18. This lab was very complex and had many steps, though I do see its application.  
I enjoyed experimenting with regular expressions and seeing how I could manipulate 
strings.  I found the most difficult part was implementing the bigram data structure.

20. I see a few distinct problems (ie. string manipulations using regular 
expressions) that Perl would be a good choice for a language.  However, I 
see greater advantages in other languages, which I have found to have greater 
readability, and would therefore be more likely to use depending on the project.
